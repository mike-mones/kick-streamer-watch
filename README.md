# Kick Streamer Watch
>  Stream Deck plugin to monitor Kick.com streamers

## Requirements
*   Stream Deck 6.9 or later

## Setup

1.  **Install the Plugin:**
    Download and install the `com.kick-streamer-watch.streamDeckPlugin` file.

2.  **Log In:**
    *   Drag the **Kick Live Status** action to a button.
    *   In the Property Inspector, click **"Log In with Kick"**.
    *   A browser window will open. Approve the access request.
    *   You will be redirected back to the plugin, and the button should turn green (or show the status).

3.  **Configure:**
    *   Enter the **Kick Username** (slug) you want to watch (e.g., `odablock`).
    *   The button will update with the streamer's live status and profile image.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Image not loading**: The plugin caches images locally. If an image fails, it will show a green (live) or red (offline) background as a fallback.
